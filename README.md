#### Resume for Applcation to Prime Digital Academy

https://briannadickman.github.io/

This is the code I submitted for my application to Prime Digital Academy. Up to this point, I had experience in HTML/CSS and some Javascript. I worked to create a resume that was personal, clean, and represented my personality and passion for design well, and I think the final result was a great measure of this.
